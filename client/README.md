## Setup

All setup I did was installing the respective packages which can be seen in package.json. Then in two separate terminals, run the server and client with:

```bash
# Server
npm install express mongoose@7.6.3 dotenv nodemon body-parser cors
npm run dev
```

```bash
# Client
npm install
npm run start
```
